# Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Google Colab)

A simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. This project allows you to play against a computer opponent or with a friend using Google Colab.

## Features

- **Single Player Mode**: Play against a computer opponent.
- **Two Player Mode**: Play with a friend using Google Colab.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: The computer opponent uses the Minimax algorithm with recursive depth-first search to make intelligent moves.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: User-friendly interface for making moves.

## How to Play

1. Open the provided Google Colab notebook.

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to make your moves.

## Gameplay Rules

- For Single Player Mode, you are "O," and the computer is "X."
- For Two Player Mode, the first player is "O," and the second player is "X."
- Once a cell is occupied, it cannot be replaced in subsequent moves.

## Minimax Algorithm

The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in two-player games, like Tic-Tac-Toe. It evaluates all possible moves and outcomes to determine the best move for the current player. In this implementation, a recursive depth-first search is employed to explore the game tree and find optimal moves.
